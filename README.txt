Ever played modded Minecraft with Crayfish's Gun Mod and Valkyrien Skies?
and then just to realize Valkyrien Skies' ships don't stop bullets from CGM?
Well I have a fix for you.

This mod allows you to use guns to fire on ships, instead of have the bullets go straight through the ship.

(the original mod was made by C0NM4N1132 on modrinth, I do NOT take any credit for the first 1.18.2 commit EXCEPT that I made a repo of it)
